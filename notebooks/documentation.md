This folder contains autoregression.ipynb, the original Jupyter notebook which performs the analysis for the EMBC paper "Comparing Autoregressive and Network Features for Classification of Depression and Anxiety." As a programming exercise, I refractored the notebook into four EDA notebooks called {}_exploration, where {} refers to the specific feature set that I was looking at, and a classifier training notebook make_classifiers.
