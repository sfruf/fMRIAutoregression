# Documentation

This folder contains autoregression.ipynb, a Jupyter notebook which performs the analysis for the paper, and a folder called Network Measures. Network Measures contains calculate_network_measures.m which uses clustering_coef_wu_sign.m and strengths_und_sign.m (both from the brain connectivity toolbox) to calculate the clustering coefficient, positive strength, and negative strength from the networks in Data using MATLAB.
