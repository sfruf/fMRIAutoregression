# Project Reflection

This project presented me with a really valuable chance to change my mindset towards the code I produce. It was a chance to set up an development environment properly and think about producing code that was reusable by myself and others.

I also used this to really focus on working clean, that I would leave the project in a state that made it easy to pick up again. It ended up being to my benefit: at some point I had some deadlines that needed to be attended to and a vacation and I had to leave this project for a few weeks. I was able to get right back into coding within 10 minutes of reopening my files. Definitely one of those "I'm never going back" moments.

## New Experiences

Setting up Docker
Using Pip-compile
Using Pickle to save models
Setting up a python package

## Ways I can make my process better

* Make my dev workflow a bit more uniform, and highlight what's going to change when this project would get moved to a production environment
* Use ONNX to save models, especially in situations that require higher security or prediction of single subjects
* Move to tools that allow automatic data and model versioning instead of the current manual system I have in place
